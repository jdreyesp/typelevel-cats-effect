## Introduction

This project is a follow-through of examples described in the Rockthejvm course 'Cats effect'. Hopefully it's useful for you to understand 
the different components in Cats effect.

Some of the chapters (mostly the recap ones) have been skipped to focus the effort on the main topic of the project. You can check out 
my other Github repositories (https://github.com/jdreyesp) for other Scala topics.

Happy coding! :)
